Municipal Structures Compliance
===============================

DCOG Tool for form compliance at municipal levels.

Project Layout
--------------

### Docker

On Linux, you probably want to set the environment variables `USER_ID=$(id -u)`
and `GROUP_ID=$(id -g)` where you run docker-compose so that the container
shares your UID and GID. This is important for the container to have permission
to modify files owned by your host user (e.g. for python-black) and your host
user to modify files created by the container (e.g. migrations).


### Django

Apps go in the project directory `msc`


### Python

Dependencies are managed via poetry in the docker container.

Add and lock dependencies in a temporary container:

    docker-compose run --rm web poetry add pkgname==1.2.3

Rebuild the image to contain the new dependencies:

    docker-compose build web

Make sure to commit updates to pyproject.toml and poetry.lock to git


### Javascript and CSS

JS and CSS are bundled using [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - see `package.json`.

Dependencies are managed via `yarn`, e.g.

    docker-compose run --rm web yarn add bootstrap@4.x

Make sure to commit updates to package.json and yarn.lock to git.


Development setup
-----------------

In one shell, run the frontend asset builder

    docker-compose run --rm web yarn dev


In another shell, initialise and run the django app

    docker-compose run --rm web bin/wait-for-postgres.sh
    docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py migrate
    docker-compose up


If you need to destroy and recreate your dev setup, e.g. if you've messed up your
database data or want to switch to a branch with an incompatible database schema,
you can destroy all volumes and recreate them by running the following, and running
the above again:

    docker-compose down --volumes


Running tests
-------------

    docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py test

Tests might fail to connect to the databse if the docker-compose `db` service wasn't running and configured yet. Just check the logs for the `db` service and run the tests again.


Settings
--------

Undefined settings result in exceptions at startup to let you know they are not configured properly. It's one this way so that the defaults don't accidentally let bad things happen like forgetting analytics or connecting to the prod DB in development.
